# XBranch
'x42' development commences 23rd July 2016

<h1>Seti@home application and tools</h1>
Based on everything learned from development with seti@home (since ~2007):
- modernised cross platform development (Grade buildsystem)
- reduced debugging through unit and built-in regression testing (reliability)
- plugin archictecture for adaptability (new devices, applications, workloads etc)
- install-time and run-time based dispatch (simplified dynamic optimisation)
- no compromise performance (optimisation), maintainability (cleaner design), AND compatibility (initially Cuda, gradually hetrerogeneous)
- More intuitive design (few options that make sense, rather than many arcane numbers.)
- Simplify necessary complexity with automation.
