# xRefinery
XBranch multipurpose development development tool 
24th July 2016 (initial buildsystem setup only)

<h1>xRefinery - Lab and proving ground</h1>
Multipurposed tool for refining xBranch elements (planned):
- Generalising device specific, self scaling code into abstract types
- Class/plugin library development aimed at reducing future development workload
- precision, accuracy, performance, reliability, reusability metrics driven refinement
- used for buildsystem refinement, to simplify cross-platform development
- Brings unit and regression testing, adapting/extending from many prior unit test pieces.
- aims toward self-scaling/optimisation, build time, install time, load time, and dynamic runtime dispatch
- encapsulation and dispatch of all hardware specific code
- polymorphism, generalisation and active thread object proving ground
